# The public corpus (#434)

A redistributable test corpus, assembled rather than inherited: this directory holds a
**manifest**, never a PDF. `fetch.sh` reproduces the documents from it on any machine and
checks every byte against a sha256, so the structure, Markdown and pages batteries can run
in CI, in a cloud sandbox, and on anyone's laptop.

That is the whole point. The private corpus is 4,337 of the owner's real documents; it can
never leave his machines, so until now the gates could only ever be run by him. This one
anybody can reproduce.

    tools/stress/public-corpus/fetch.sh                  # → ~/megapdf-public-corpus
    tools/stress/public-corpus/fetch.sh /data/corpus --jobs 8
    tools/stress/public-corpus/fetch.sh --verify-only    # re-check what is on disk

The two corpora are different populations and are **expected to give different numbers**.
See TESTING.md, "Which corpus gates what".

## Network reality — two different machines, two different answers

The corpus was first built (#434) from the Anthropic cloud sandbox, which cannot reach any
`.gov` host at all. It was extended (this change) from **kdocker3**, a real machine with
ordinary internet access, specifically to add the one category the sandbox could never
reach: real US federal fillable forms.

**From the Anthropic cloud sandbox** — measured 2026-09-27, `403 CONNECT`: the container's
egress proxy refuses the tunnel outright, so the request never reaches the host.

| #434 source | host | status | in the corpus? |
|---|---|---|---|
| IRS fillable forms | `www.irs.gov` | **403 CONNECT** | now yes — added from kdocker3 |
| USCIS forms | `www.uscis.gov` | **403 CONNECT** | now yes — added from kdocker3 |
| govinfo bulk | `www.govinfo.gov`, `api.govinfo.gov` | **403 CONNECT** | no — out of scope for now, see below |
| SafeDocs / UNSAFE-DOCS | `digitalcorpora.org`, `downloads.digitalcorpora.org` | **403 CONNECT** | no — out of scope for now |
| Isartor suite | `pdfa.org` | **403 CONNECT** | yes, *via veraPDF* (below) |
| veraPDF corpus | `github.com` (git), `raw.githubusercontent.com` | **200 / 206** | yes |
| qpdf, PDFium fixtures | `github.com` (git), `raw.githubusercontent.com` | **200 / 206** | yes |

Two details worth knowing before you conclude a source is unreachable from the sandbox:

* Plain HTTPS to `github.com` is **scoped to the session's own repositories** and answers
  403 with a JSON body for anything else — but the **anonymous git lane** (`git clone`,
  `git ls-remote`) serves any public repository, and `raw.githubusercontent.com` serves
  individual files at a pinned commit with no scoping at all. That is the door every
  git-sourced row in this manifest goes through.
* Everything else tried was refused: `chromium.googlesource.com`, `pdfium.googlesource.com`,
  `www.gpo.gov`, `www.sec.gov`, `europa.eu`, `archive.org`.

**From kdocker3** — measured 2026-09-27, plain `curl`, one representative URL per host:

| host | status |
|---|---|
| `www.irs.gov` (`/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf`) | **200** |
| `www.uscis.gov` (`/sites/default/files/document/forms/i-9.pdf`) | **200** |
| `www.govinfo.gov` | **200** (a specific Federal Register PDF); **302** on `/robots.txt` |

All three #434 names are reachable from a real machine. `govinfo` and `safedocs` are **not**
implemented here even though `govinfo` is reachable — #434 asks for a *bulk* generator for
it and nobody has designed or verified one yet; that stays a future extension, not a silent
scope-creep of this one. This change adds exactly the one category #434 and the current
milestone call "the highest-value" and "what a cloud sandbox could not reach": real federal
fillable forms, from IRS and USCIS.

**One fetching wrinkle, because it cost real time to find.** This container's apt-installed
`curl` (8.5.0, OpenSSL 3.0.13) is refused outright by `www.uscis.gov` — `403`, `server:
AkamaiGHost` — even with a browser `User-Agent` string. It is a TLS/HTTP2 fingerprint match,
not an IP block or a robots rule: Python's `urllib` (same host, same network path, same
container) is **not** refused. `build-manifest.py`'s federal-forms fetcher therefore uses
`urllib`, not `curl`, for both IRS and USCIS. `fetch.sh` (bash + curl) is unaffected because
by the time anyone runs it the rows are already in the manifest with their own pinned
hashes — it just downloads and verifies bytes, it does not need to out-fingerprint Akamai.
If `fetch.sh` itself is ever refused this way on some other machine, that is the same
symptom and the same fix (a different HTTP client, or a newer curl/OpenSSL build).

## What is in it

1,349 documents, 140.2 MB. Categories are assigned from each file's own bytes by
`build-manifest.py`'s `classify()`, not from the directory it arrived in, so a row says what
the battery will actually meet.

| category | count | what it is |
|---|---:|---|
| `form` | 549 | `/AcroForm` — fields, checkboxes, radio groups, signature fields (see below: `/Widget` alone is not required any more) |
| `tagged` | 300 | a `/StructTreeRoot`, for the tagged-PDF path (#358) |
| `report` | 250 | ordinary text documents, for extraction fidelity and reading order |
| `malformed` | 150 | deliberately broken or deliberately non-conforming — crash/hang resistance only |
| `scan` | 100 | image pages with no font resources |

By source: veraPDF 860, qpdf 181, PDFium 122, **IRS 136**, **USCIS 50**.

`form` is the one category taken **whole** — every one the sources contain — because it is
what MegaPDF is for and the category #434 calls the private corpus thinnest on. The others
are sampled on an even stride across the sorted tree, which is reproducible and does not
hand back every test for one specification clause and nothing after it.

### A classification bug this extension found and fixed

`classify()` used to require **both** `/AcroForm` and `/Widget` to appear literally in a
file's raw bytes before calling it a `form`; without `/Widget` too, a file with a struct
tree fell through to `tagged` instead. That was fine for the small, usually-uncompressed git
fixtures already here, but every real IRS/USCIS form is generated by modern, accessibility-
tagged software that stores its `Widget` annotations inside a **compressed object stream**
— invisible to a raw-byte scan — while `/AcroForm` itself sits in the (uncompressed) catalog
dictionary. Left as-is, this would have silently filed 185 of the 186 new federal forms
under `tagged`, not `form` — exactly backwards for the category this whole extension exists
to fill. Verified with `qpdf --qdf` (which decompresses object streams for inspection): all
186 do carry real `/Widget` annotations once decompressed.

The fix drops the `/Widget` requirement — `has_acroform` alone now selects `form`, ahead of
the `tagged` check — matching the comment already on that code ("a form is a form even when
it is also tagged"), which the old `and has_widget` silently defeated. This also reclassified
126 **existing** git-sourced fixtures from `tagged` to `form` (237 → 363 before the federal
rows were added), the same shape appearing in some of veraPDF's and qpdf's own modern test
files. `tools/stress/public-corpus/build-manifest.py`'s `classify()` has the full comment;
this is a manifest-generation fix, not a change to the engine, a battery, or a gate.

## The federal forms (#434 federal-forms extension)

136 IRS forms and 50 USCIS forms, chosen deliberately rather than however many a scraper
happened to find, and grouped so the choice is legible:

| group | count | why |
|---|---:|---|
| IRS 1040-family | 21 | the most-filed federal form and its core schedules: filing-status radio group, checkboxes throughout, Schedule 8812/EIC repeating dependent rows, Schedule E's repeating property rows |
| IRS simple | 17 | near-one-page forms with no repeating structure — a baseline so "real forms are hard" doesn't overstate the case |
| IRS signature | 4 | Form 2848 (power of attorney, with its own repeating representative table), 8821, 8879, 8453 — forms whose entire purpose is a signature field |
| IRS credits | 28 | adjustments and credits with repeating rows (depreciation assets, capital-gain transactions, noncash-contribution items, monthly premium-credit tables) and checkbox/radio groups |
| IRS long | 34 | multi-page business/entity returns — 1120, 1065, 990, 706, 709, 1041, 5471, 8865, 3520(-A), the CIS 433 series — with deep `/Parent` hierarchies and repeating subforms (K-1 schedules, shareholder/partner tables): the shape #174's page-import refuses today, and the reason this source exists |
| IRS employment | 12 | checkbox-heavy quarterly/annual employment and excise returns |
| IRS info-returns | 20 | the 1098/1099 families: multi-copy layouts, void/corrected checkboxes — the shape a payroll or accounting integration actually feeds in |
| USCIS simple | 11 | short forms: I-9's checkbox-heavy attestation, G-28/G-325A/G-1145/G-639 administrative forms |
| USCIS long | 39 | long petitions and applications with deep hierarchical/repeating sections (family members, employment and address history) — the immigration-side counterpart of the IRS "long" group. Includes I-864's repeating household-member table and N-400, the longest and most heavily sectioned form either agency publishes |

The 1040 family, common schedules, and a spread of USCIS petitions are the backbone the
current milestone asked for by name. `f1099b.pdf` 404s as of 2026-09-27 (IRS's own
"about this form" page links to it, but the file is not there) and is skipped rather than
guessed at — one retired-or-broken link out of 187 candidates checked.

Every filename was resolved from the agency's own per-form page (IRS's `/forms-pubs/about-
form-*`, USCIS's `/sites/default/files/document/forms/*`) and fetched, hashed and confirmed
to start with `%PDF` before going in the manifest — see `build-manifest.py`'s `IRS_FORMS` /
`USCIS_FORMS` for the exact list and grouping, and "Extending" below for how to re-verify or
extend it.

**A real difference from the git sources, stated plainly.** veraPDF/qpdf/PDFium rows are
pinned to a **commit** — the sha256 is true forever, because the bytes at that commit never
change. IRS/USCIS rows are pinned to **today's bytes at a live URL** — there is no commit to
pin. If either agency revises a form, a future `--add-source` run will fetch different bytes
and the sha256 will change; `fetch.sh`'s existing "a wrong hash is a hard, named failure,
never silently re-fetched over" behaviour is exactly the right response to that, and needed
no changes to produce it. This is also why federal rows are **not** part of the default
`build-manifest.py` rebuild (see "Extending"): a plain rebuild stays fully reproducible from
a sandbox that cannot reach either host, exactly as it always has.

## ⚠ The malformed set

The 150 documents under `malformed` are **deliberately broken by design**. They exist to prove
the engine does not crash or hang, and nothing else. Some may trip anti-malware on the way
past. Open them with the engine under test; do not open them with something you care about,
and do not treat a refusal to parse one as a defect — a refusal is the correct answer.

Note this is *not* the SafeDocs sample #434 asks for: `digitalcorpora.org` remains
unreachable from the sandbox this corpus's core is built in, and implementing a `safedocs`
generator is out of scope for this change. These are Isartor's PDF/A-violating files and
qpdf's damaged-file fixtures, which are adjacent but milder. They are spec violations and
structural damage, not the adversarial fuzzed population SafeDocs provides.

## Licences and attribution

Every document here is redistributable. That was settled in #434 and is not re-litigated by
adding a source: nothing goes in the manifest without a licence that lets a third party fetch
and keep the file.

| source | licence | attribution required |
|---|---|---|
| [veraPDF-corpus](https://github.com/veraPDF/veraPDF-corpus) @ `bb75f4f0` | **CC BY 4.0** | **yes** — see below |
| [qpdf](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf) test suite @ `4eba9589` | Apache-2.0 | notice retained |
| [PDFium](https://github.com/chromium/pdfium) `testing/resources` @ `a8432342` | BSD-3-Clause | notice retained |
| IRS fillable forms (`www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/`) | **public domain — 17 U.S.C. § 105** | no |
| USCIS forms (`www.uscis.gov/.../document/forms/`) | **public domain — 17 U.S.C. § 105** | no |

CC BY 4.0 requires attribution wherever these files or results derived from them are
published. The required credit:

> veraPDF test corpus © the veraPDF Consortium, used under
> [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Not modified.

**Federal works: 17 U.S.C. § 105.** "Copyright protection under this title is not available
for any work of the United States Government." An IRS or USCIS form is prepared by federal
employees as part of their official duties, so no copyright ever attaches to it in the first
place — there is no licence to comply with, and no attribution requirement, though the
manifest records `source` (`irs` / `uscis`) and a plain-English attribution string in
`build-manifest.py` anyway, as a provenance trail rather than a legal obligation. This is a
**stronger** position than any of the git sources above: those are copyrighted works
licensed to permit redistribution; federal forms are simply never copyrighted at all.

**One licence nuance, stated rather than buried.** 117 of the `malformed` rows are the
**Isartor test files**, which arrive inside the veraPDF repository and are therefore covered
by that repository's blanket CC BY 4.0 statement. Isartor's own terms (pdfa.org) are narrower:
free to use for checking validation software, and **must not be used to claim that MegaPDF is
certified or conformant**. Both constraints are treated as binding here. What was *not*
verified — `pdfa.org` being unreachable from the sandbox this corpus's core is built in — is
whether the veraPDF Consortium holds the right to relicense Isartor's files under CC BY 4.0.
Treat those 117 rows as Isartor-terms files that happen to be distributed by veraPDF, and
never cite a run over them as a conformance claim.

## Extending

`build-manifest.py` regenerates the **git-sourced** part of the manifest from scratch, so
that part of the corpus is a function of its sources rather than a pile someone once
assembled:

    tools/stress/public-corpus/build-manifest.py --work /var/tmp/pc-build

Each git source is pinned to a commit, never a branch — a branch would silently invalidate
every sha256 in the file. To add one: give it a licence that permits redistribution, add a
`Source` row, pin the commit, and rebuild. **A plain rebuild never touches the network for
the federal-forms rows and never deletes them either** — it preserves whatever `irs`/`uscis`
rows are already in `--out`, so it stays exactly as reproducible from a blocked sandbox as
it always was.

To (re)fetch the federal forms, from a machine that can reach the host — `www.irs.gov` and
`www.uscis.gov` are both unreachable from Anthropic's cloud sandbox, reachable from an
ordinary machine (see "Network reality" above):

    tools/stress/public-corpus/build-manifest.py --add-source irs
    tools/stress/public-corpus/build-manifest.py --add-source uscis

Each merges its rows into the existing `manifest.tsv` (by URL: a matching sha256 is left
alone, a changed one is refreshed, a new one is added) rather than rebuilding everything
from nothing. `IRS_FORMS` / `USCIS_FORMS` in `build-manifest.py` are the exact, grouped list;
add a filename there (verified as `%PDF`-starting and fetchable first) to extend either set,
or add a new `HttpSource` to `FEDERAL_SOURCES` for a different agency under the same public-
domain licence. `--add-source govinfo` and `--add-source safedocs` still refuse outright —
see `SOURCES_BLOCKED` — because nobody has yet written and verified a generator for either;
that refusal is deliberate, the same way `irs`/`uscis` used to refuse before this change,
and should be resolved the same way: implement and verify it from a machine that can reach
the host, don't just delete the refusal.
